# Trip-Planner-app-using-REST-API

In this project we’ll create a REST API using Node.js and Express.This API will expose a set of GET and POST endpoints to allow getting data out, 
and sending data in.We’ll use a MongoDB database to store this data. We’re not going to create the frontend of the application here, just the API.
